# Rigid Body Simulation

## What is this?
This is a program to use OpenGL to do rigid body simulation. 

Currently I am still learning the basics and experimenting the concept so it will have limited features and bugs. In the future I will be constantly adding more stuff such as movable camera and better graphical interface.
